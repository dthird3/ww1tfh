  Estonian Army


    21 October 1919

 
The material is supplied by Reigo Rosenthal, who is pretty much
theexpert on this front of the war.

The number value in square brackets [X] is a value judgement by Reigo on
the quality of the unit, from 1 to 5. (As a comparsion 1 is the level of
a fairly standard Soviet unit on this front. None of Iudenich's units
make it to 5.) However this number applies only when the Estonians are
fighting in Estonia or in defense of the border area. If they are acting
deeper in Russia or have to attack into Russia, then take one or two
quality points away.

The number of men in companies varied greatly in the first half of war,
but by this stage one can assume around 100-120 bayonets and 4-5 MGs in
an infantry company. The landing battalions of the armored trains had
about 50 men in a company. The batteries usually had 4 guns, however
some may have had less.
