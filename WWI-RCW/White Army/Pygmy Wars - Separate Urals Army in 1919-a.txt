    Omissions

This list appears to leave out any units part of another host, so the
13th Orenburg Cossack Regiment is not listed.

The strength of the Astrakhan Infantry Divizion appears seriously wrong.
Firstly it is extra-ordinarily large. All other sources give a
reasonable sized infantry unit (often designating it Astrakhan Plastoon
Regiment), but also list an Astrakhan Cossack Regiment and another
non-Urals Cavalry Regiment.


    Strengths

The total listed is 419 officers, 10,415 sabres, 5,120 bayonets, 265 MGs
and 35 guns.

These numbers are for actual men with rifles or sabres actively fighting
in the formation. As such they grossly underestimate the actual strength
of the army – for example even front-line gunners in the artillery units
are excluded.
