  Caucasian Army


  18 October 1919


      Also known as the "Cossack Army" or the "Army of the Caucasus".


There is a full order of battle for the AFSR for 29 September 1919,
which had a revision on 18 October, 1919 (or 16 September and 5 October
in the Old Style dates). The list below is worked off the figures for
that later date, but taking a few details over from the first, and
adding stuff in from Volkov's Encyclopedia of the White Army.

I have left it in .html rather than put it in .pdf because I expect to
have to correct mistakes from time to time.
