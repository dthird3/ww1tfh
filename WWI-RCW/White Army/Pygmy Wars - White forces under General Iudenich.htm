  North-Western Army


    21 October 1919

 
This is the NW Army after a reorganisation, almost at its peak. Like all
orders of battle, this is only a snapshot of a certain moment and in
this case a treacherous one as the army had grown so rapidly. It was
soon to fall apart equally quickly, so many units had only a very brief
existence. Units which are particularly uncertain are *marked with
asterisks*.

The material is supplied by Reigo Rosenthal, who is pretty much the
expert on this front of the war.

The number value in square brackets [X] is a value judgement by Reigo on
the quality of the unit, from 1 to 5. (As a comparison 1 is the level of
a fairly standard Soviet unit on this front. Only a very few Estonian
units get 5.)

Regiments, and possibly 4 light guns (see bottom of the page).

By the middle of November the Division had the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
Batteries of the 2nd Independent Light Artillery Divizion plus the 1st
and 3rd Battery of the 1st Independent Howitzer Artillery Divizion. This
probably arrived in late October.

In the second half of October the Division was supported by tanks (3 at
a time) and sometimes the Swedish White Legion with them.

The 1st Battery of the 3rd Separate Light Artillery Divizion arrived at
the end of October. The howitzers left in mid-October.

The Gatchina Jaeger Regiment started to form at this time in recently
captured Gatchina. It is possible that this was using the Reserve
Battalion as a cadre.

At this time, and for a short while afterwards the division was
supported by an improvised armoured train made in Gatchina. It probably
had artillery pieces.

The 17th, 18th and 19th Regiments were formerly the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
Prince Lieven Regiments, which had started out in Latvia (Libau is
Liepaja in German).

The 20th Chudskoy Rgt was operating with the 1st Division.

The 24th Infantry Regiment was newly formed and officially part of the
6th Division but at this time operating under this Division.

The Baltic Regiment was a unit of the Estonian Army formed around
Estonians of German extraction, but the other ranks of the 3rd company
were Russians. A light battery of two guns soon arrived, but immediately
went to the Shock Group. (1st and 2nd Companies remained in the rear at
this time.)

The numbers cited by Volkov appear to be men, not bayonets. A figure of
1,350 bayonets is also given.

By the end of the month there were 4 German howitzers in the howitzer
battery.
