Latvia 1919


  Latvia 1919


featuring Germans, Balts, Russians, Estonians and even some Latvians.
 
 
Initially I became interested in the Freikorps in the Baltic because I
wondered how 50,000 crack German Freikorps could be beaten in late 1919
by the 20,000 men of the hastily raised Latvian army. There is little
written about the campaign in English or French, but eventually I
managed to piece enough together to understand that the story in most
books on the period is completely wrong. The Freikorps in Latvia were
not the crack troops of most histories, but men with wildly conflicting
aims in an increasingly difficult situation. Latvians have every right
to be proud of their ancestors' performance at the Battle of Riga, but
their opponents were considerably less numerous than generally stated,
not to mention already half beaten morally.
 


    The general history of Latvia in 1919

My findings, gleaned by me from various sources. Since I don't read
German, Estonian, Latvian or Russian, I make no pretense that they are
complete or 100% accurate, but I feel confident that they are a huge
improvement on what is available in the non-specialist literature in
English.

    The Battle of C?sis

I have also been able to write a fairly detailed history of the Battle
of C?sis, but none of the credit is mine. Firstly Reigo Rosenthal
provided me with an enormous amount of information from Estonian
sources. To this Daniel Staberg added some stuff from German sources and
balanced out the Estonian view a bit. Valdis Kursietis added some
information about the Latvians, and Eduardo Lopez did a spot of
translating. Thank-you very much Daniel, Valdis, Eduardo and Reigo!

The following maps from Eesti Vabadussõda (the official Estonian history
of their independence struggle) will help follow the account:

    Orders of battle and maps of troop placements

I would like at some time to do a similar treatment of the Battle of
Riga/Thorensberg, but in the meantime this is all I have:

I have very little interest in the fighting against the Soviets
(especially since it seems that the valiant and noble Freikorps were
actually not outnumbered like they made out) but I have collected some
bits and pieces that might interest others and Reigo Rosenthal has
kindly supplied a couple of cool maps of the Soviet movements in early
1919. (NB: the files are quite large.)

    Wargaming the theatre

I have drawn up some notes which might help people intending to game the
Freikorps' actions.
