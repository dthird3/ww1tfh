These regiments had been just prior to this the 8th, 11th and 12th Don
Horse Brigades, but they were particularly badly affected by desertion
following Mamontov's raid of the previous months.  The "composite" of
their title reflects this.

    Total Numbers

Volkov gives a total for this period of 25,834 bayonets, 24,689 sabres,
1,343 sappers, 1,077 MGs, 212 guns (183 light, 8 heavy, 7 trench and 14
howitzers), 6 airplanes, 7 armoured trains, 4 tanks and 4 armoured cars,
but it should be noted that this is the total of all the totals above:
if a unit doesn't have figures then it isn't counted for this total, so
the actual count was somewhat higher.

Dobrynin gives the Don Army as 46,500 men, 192 guns and 939 MGs for 14
October 1919. I presume he was not counting the Kuban Corps though.

The Osprey Armoured Units of the RCW: White and Allied gives a lot more
armoured cars. Missing from the above list is Ataman Kaledin,
Steregushchi, Colonel Bezmolitvenni (Garford?),  Partisan (Austin),
Cossack (Austin), Spolokh (Lanchester) and Ust-Belokalitynets (Austin).
