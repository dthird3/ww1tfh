  Russian Army

16 October 1920

 
These are the White forces with which Wrangel broke out of the Crimea.
It is taken from Slashchev-Krimskii's Crimea 1920.

It is based on a Soviet intelligence assessment, so was already out of
date and wrong on several points. However, I cannot believe Slashchev
would have included it in his book if it was totally useless, and it
does have some interesting information.

For most purposes a better orbat can be found in Tom Hillman's
Trans-Dnepr Operation.
