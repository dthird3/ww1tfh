


Target 1 - The Russian Orthodox Church
	Already in 1917, the Bolsheviks nationalized Orthodox church lands, took over all Orthodox schools, and allowed only civil marriages.
	In 1918, a law followed that completely separated church and state, exposing religious organizations to random assaults. 
Target 2 - The Socialist Revolutionary Party
Target 3 - The Komuch
	Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly in Russian. with headquarters at Samara. 
	It was formed in protest of the Bolsheviks' dispersion of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.
	The Komuch set up an anti-Bolshevik government on the Volga on June 8, 1918. The Komuch also mustered an army, the People's Army.
Target 4 - The Mensheviks
Target 5 - The Czechoslovak Legion
	The Czech Legion, started at 30,000 and eventually this group counted approx. 100,000 heads. 
	The goal of the Czech Legion was to get to the Western Front before the end of WWI, to claim national independency from Austria-Hungary, 
	and to fight with the Allies against their former employer, the Austrian government. 
	The idea was to reach Vladivostok by Trans-Siberian Railway and to depart from Vladivostok via ship.
	In March 1918, the trip was approved by the Bolshevik government.
	At the end of May 1918, the Bolshevik government ordered the Czechoslovak Legion to surrender their arms. 
	The Czechs preferred not to become prisoners again, refused the order, took control of the trans-Siberian railroad, 
	teamed up with the Right Socialist Revolutionaries in Samara
	By June 1918, the two sides were fighting each other along the railway route from Penza to Krasnoyarsk. 
	At the end of that month, the legionaries in Vladivostok under General Mikhail Diterikhs joined the struggle by deposing the soviet in the port 
	and began retracing their journey across Siberia to support their comrades fighting to their west. 
	Generally, the Czechoslovaks were the victors in their early engagements against the fledging Red Army. 
	By mid-July, the legionaries had seized control of the railway from Samara to Irkutsk, and by the beginning of September they cleared Bolshevik 
	forces the entire length of the Trans-Siberian Railway.
	
Siberian Expedition	
	In early July 1918 he published an aide-mémoire calling for a limited intervention in Siberia by the U.S. and Japan to rescue the Czechoslovak 
	troops, who were then blocked by Bolshevik forces in Transbaikal. But by the time most American and Japanese units landed in Vladivostok, 
	the Czechoslovaks largely “rescued” themselves. Nevertheless, the Allied intervention in Siberia continued so that by autumn 1918 there were 
	70,000 Japanese, 829 British, 1,400 Italian, 5,002 American and 107 French colonial (Vietnamese) troops in the region.
	
	On 28 October 1918 Czechoslovak statehood was declared in Prague, arousing the troops with a desire to return to their homeland. 
	The final blow to Czechoslovak morale arrived on 18 November 1918, when a coup in Omsk overthrew the All-Russian Provisional Government and 
	installed a dictatorship under Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in control of White Siberia.
	
	On 14 November 1919 the Reds took Omsk, Kolchak’s capital, initiating a desperate eastward flight by the White army
	On 7 February 1920, the legionaries had signed an armistice with the Fifth Red Army at Kutin whereby the latter allowed the Czechoslovaks 
	unmolested passage to Vladivostok for the remainder of their journey. 
	In exchange, the legionaries agreed not to rescue Kolchak and leave the remaining gold bullion with the authorities in Irkutsk.
	
	Finally arriving in Vladivostok, the Czechs took the boat direction San Francisco, United States. 
	From there, cross country, across the Atlantic and eventually back to Europe. 
	The departure of the entire corps from Russia took from May 1920 to the last legionaries left the port in September 1920. 
	
Target 6 - The Siberian Army
	Anti-Bolshevik troops from Omsk, led by Alexander Kolchak.	
	(Polish: 5. Dywizja Strzelców Polskich; also known as the Siberian Division joined the ranks of the White Guard of admiral Alexander Kolchak. 
	Together with the White Russians, and elements of the Czechoslovak Legion, the unit defended Siberia against the Red Army.  Essentially withdrew 
	with the Czech Legion.
Target 7 - The Ukrainian Army
	The Ukraine was ready for independence and declared itself a sovereign republic in 1918. 
	Symon Vasylevych Petlyura led the Ukrainian Army.
Target 8 - The Don Army
	Anti-Bolshevik Cossacks from the Don, led by Pyotr Nikolayevich Krasnov.
Target 9 - Other Independence Seeking Nations
	Azerbaijan declared independence in 1918, and so did Georgia. 
	The Soviet Republic of Armenia was established in 1920. 
	The Reds had all of the above back in the fold by 1936.
Target 10 - The Black Army
	Anarchists in the Ukraine, led by Nestor Ivanovich Makhno, who fought very effectively as guerrillas. 
	At least for a while. The Blacks were against Reds and Whites alike.
Target 11 - The Green Army
	Around 40,000, maybe more, angry peasants from the Tambov region who, siding with neither Red nor White, became brothers-in-arms in August 1920. 
	Also referred to as the Tambov Uprising or the Tambov Rebellion.
	Leader of the rebellion was Petr Mikhailovich Tokmakov, also spelled Pyotr Mikhailovich Tokmakov or Peter Mikhailovich Tokmakov. 
	Tokmakov was killed in battle in early 1921.
Target 12 - The Basmachi
	Also spelled Basmachestvo. Muslim guerrilla fighters based at Tashkent, located in today's Uzbekistan. 
	The Basmachi Revolt started in 1917 and was crushed by 1926.
Target 13 - The Central Powers and the Allies of WWI
	White forces also received support from foreign powers.
	Before their surrender in WWI on November 11, 1918, the Germans helped out with arms and ammunition.
	In March 1918, and with the permission from the Soviets, the Allies landed at Murmansk.
	Japanese forces thought they might as well and landed at Vladivostok, without any permission. 
	However, the Japanese had an agreement with the Americans.
	The U.S. sent troops to Archangel (Archangelsk) calling it the Polar Bear Expedition and to Vladivostok on the Siberian Expedition. 
	The Siberian Expedition was organized to keep an eye on Japan, who was playing with thoughts of territorial expansion.
