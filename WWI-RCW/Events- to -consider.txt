Siberian Expedition	
	In early July 1918 he published an aide-mémoire calling for a limited intervention in Siberia by the U.S. and Japan to rescue the Czechoslovak 
	troops, who were then blocked by Bolshevik forces in Transbaikal. But by the time most American and Japanese units landed in Vladivostok, 
	the Czechoslovaks largely “rescued” themselves. Nevertheless, the Allied intervention in Siberia continued so that by autumn 1918 there were 
	70,000 Japanese, 829 British, 1,400 Italian, 5,002 American and 107 French colonial (Vietnamese) troops in the region.
	
	On 14 November 1919 the Reds took Omsk, Kolchak’s capital, initiating a desperate eastward flight by the White army 
	- check dates of Czech and Kolchak - these two events may initiate the withdrawal on the Czech Legion

	On 7 February 1920, the legionaries had signed an armistice with the Fifth Red Army at Kutin whereby the latter allowed the Czechoslovaks 
	unmolested passage to Vladivostok for the remainder of their journey. 
	In exchange, the legionaries agreed not to rescue Kolchak and leave the remaining gold bullion with the authorities in Irkutsk.
	December 17, 1919
	Kolchak is overthrown and is forced to resign. General Nikolay Semenov is the new leader of the White Russian government in Siberia.
	
The Siberian Army (when active?)  Kolchak led coup of the Komuch and continued
	Anti-Bolshevik troops from Omsk, led by Alexander Kolchak.	
	(Polish: 5. Dywizja Strzelców Polskich; also known as the Siberian Division joined the ranks of the White Guard of admiral Alexander Kolchak. 
	
The Black Army
	Anarchists in the Ukraine, led by Nestor Ivanovich Makhno, who fought very effectively as guerrillas. 
	At least for a while. The Blacks were against Reds and Whites alike.  
	The Blacks eventually signed an alliance with the Reds and was a big factor in the demise of the Whites.
	
The Green Army
	Around 40,000, maybe more, angry peasants from the Tambov region who, siding with neither Red nor White, became brothers-in-arms in August 1920.

The Central Powers and the Allies of WWI
	White forces also received support from foreign powers.
	Before their surrender in WWI on November 11, 1918, the Germans helped out with arms and ammunition.
	In March 1918, and with the permission from the Soviets, the Allies landed at Murmansk.
	Japanese forces thought they might as well and landed at Vladivostok, without any permission. 
	However, the Japanese had an agreement with the Americans.
	The U.S. sent troops to Archangel (Archangelsk) calling it the Polar Bear Expedition and to Vladivostok on the Siberian Expedition. 
	The Siberian Expedition was organized to keep an eye on Japan, who was playing with thoughts of territorial expansion.

	But need to have Bolshevik units there as Garrisons or occupation forces.
