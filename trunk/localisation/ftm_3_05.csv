EVTDESC4501;It was during the Winter War (1939–1940), between Finland and the Soviet Union, that Simo Hayha began his duty as a sniper and against the Red Army. In temperatures between -40 and -20 degrees Celsius, dressed completely in white camouflage, Hayha was credited with 505 confirmed plus 37 unconfirmed kills of Soviet soldiers. The unofficial Finnish front line figure from the battlefield of Kollaa places the number of Hayha's sniper kills at over 800. Besides his sniper kills, Hayha was also credited with over two hundred kills with a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun, thus bringing his credited kills to at least 705. Remarkably, all of Hayha's kills were accomplished in fewer than 100 days at a time of year with very short hours of daylight.;It was during the Winter War (1939–1940), between Finland and the Soviet Union, that Simo Hayha began his duty as a sniper and against the Red Army.
