The sight of Admiral of the Fleet Sir R. Keyes, voting against his own government while in full uniform shook the moral of the Conservative back benchers. Only a new Prime Minister could command support in the House of Commons. It was down to either Churchill or Halifax to lead the country, but Halifax was a peer and this could cause problems in leading a government. Chamberlain called together Halifax, Churchill and the government chief whip David Margesson. Chamberlain asked whom the King should call as the next Prime Minster.;Question put, 'That this House do now adjourn' The Ayes to the left 281, the Noes to the right 200.\nChamberlain had a commanding majority in the Commons, but with 41 Conservative MPs voting to bring down their own government and a further 60 refusing to support it, it was clear that Chamberlain’s support was crumbling.
