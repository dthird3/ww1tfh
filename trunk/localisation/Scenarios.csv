SCENARIO_PolishBolshevikWar_DESC;Jozef Pilsudski Chief of State for Poland felt the time was right to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible.  Lenin meanwhile saw Poland as the bridge the Red Army had to cross to assist other communist movements and bring about other European revolutions.  By 1919 Polish forces had taken control of much of Western Ukraine.,The West Ukrainian People's Republic had tried unsuccessfully to create a Ukrainian state that both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim.  At the same time in the Russian part of Ukraine Symon Petliura tried to defend and strengthen the Ukrainian People's Republic. As the Bolsheviks began to gain the upper hand in the Russian Civil War they started to advance towards the disputed Ukrainian territories.,By the end of 1919 a clear front had formed and Ukraine decided to ally with Poland. Border skirmishes escalated into open warfare following Poland's major incursion further east into Ukraine in April 1920.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
