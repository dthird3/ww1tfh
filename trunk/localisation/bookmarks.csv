The War to End all Wars was over and the only task now was to win the peace. When the French field marshal Ferdinand Foch saw the resulting peace of Versailles he declared, “This is not peace. It is an armistice for 20 years”. It is now the 1st of January 1936 and Foch’s remark is already looking particularly perceptive.;On the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in the Year of Our Lord 1918 the guns fell silent.

GATHERING_STORM_DESC;War rages in Asia, as Japanese troops continue their relentless assault in China. In Europe the Treaty of Versailles is dead and the hope for peace is all but dead. Germany has rearmed, remilitarised the Rhineland and annexed Austria. Already her eyes are turned to the Sudetenland, of which Hitler will say, “It is the last territorial claim which I have to make in Europe”. The British may be willing to trust Hitler one last time, but after that there will be few alternatives.;War rages in Asia, as Japanese troops continue their relentless assault in China.

But Churchill was made of sterner stuff than Chamberlain, Churchill who vowed that “I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us” and would not be cowed. Checked in the West,  the lure of the East became irresistible for Hitler and the German Army. Their troops are massed on the Eastern border, and the two great Titans of Europe are about to clash. ;The Battle of France ended in just 6 weeks, and the German armies are triumphant once more.
