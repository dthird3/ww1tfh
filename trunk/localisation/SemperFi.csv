The German forces tried to move into the city and take over the bridges leading over the Maas River. The Dutch however managed to destroy all of the bridges and then the only task that remained was to hold off the Germans as long as they could. German losses in men and vehicles were high. However, the situation for the light Dutch infantry became critical as more and more German armoured vehicles were committed. Many defenders were killed or wounded by the German fire. Headquarters was contacted and the Dutch resistance at Maastricht was ordered to cease. Lieutenant-Colonel Govers went to the Wilhelminabrug under the banner of truce. Soon contact was established.

Critical errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin himself, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly-trained forces, led to a successful German pincer attack cutting off advancing Soviet troops from the rest of the front.;;;;;;;;;x

When the German offensive was launched in May 1940, Calais was subjected to increasingly heavy bombing, which caused disruption to military movements. On 20 May, the Germans seized Abbeville on the River Somme, capturing the last bridges over the river before the sea, and effectively isolating the BEF in Flanders and Picardy, cut off from its logistic bases. The War Office in Britain hastily despatched troops to the Channel ports, in case they were required either to re-supply the BEF or evacuate it.

In response to the Allied movements, the Germans sent a small force into San Marino to guard their lines of communication. After a few days, the main thrust of the offensive was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Division attacked forces of the 278. Infanterie-Division, which held two hills just across the Sanmarinese border.

Recognizing the failed counterattack, all Polish forces were ordered to fall back, regroup in Eastern Poland for a last stand, and wait for aid from Great Britain and France, which would never come.;;;;;;;;;x

Hlegu was also in Japanese hands as the British approached. The Japanese had erected a roadblock and they defended it with molotov cocktails. In the end, they were forced to retreat in the face of heavy fire from the tanks. General Alexander had realised that Rangoon was doomed, and his new plan involved a withdrawal to Prome, some 200 miles to the north.

EVTDESC796;We have lost the battle of Rabaul!\n\nThe Battle of Rabaul took place in January and February 1942. In January 1942, Rabaul came under attack by large numbers of Japanese carrier-based aircraft. On 21 January, eight Wirraways attacked a formation of 109 Japanese aircraft. Three RAAF planes were shot down, two crash-landed, and another was damaged. As a result of the intense air attacks, Australian coastal artillery was destroyed and Australian infantry were withdrawn from Rabaul itself. Rabaul became the biggest Japanese base in New Guinea. The Australians tried to restrict its development soon after its capture by a bombing counter attack in March. In December 1943, during the Battle of Cape Gloucester, U.S. Marines landed in western New Britain and consequent Allied operations on New Britain gradually restricted the Japanese force to Rabaul. However, a large number of Japanese personnel remained in Rabaul until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.;We have lost the battle of Rabaul!\n\nThe Battle of Rabaul took place in January and February 1942.

However, the Japanese stretched too far out westward and were counter-attacked by Chinese forces from the south and the north, forcing them to retreat eastward. On September 23 the Japanese drove the Chinese out of the Sinchiang river area. Heavy fighting continued after the 23rd and the Chinese retreated southward to distract the Japanese while supporting battalions arrived in the east and the west for an encirclement maneuver. On September 29 the Japanese reached the outskirts of Changsha. However, they were unable to conquer the city because the Chinese cut off their supply lines.

The Basque government reported 1,654 people killed, but modern research suggests between 200 to 400 civilians died.

The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces, and was the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign until that date. From July 1940 coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres such as Portsmouth were the main targets. One month later the Luftwaffe shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure. As the battle progressed the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure. Eventually the Luftwaffe resorted to attacking areas of political significance and using terror bombing tactics.

A conservative estimate places the number of bombing runs at more than 5,000, with more than 11,500 bombs dropped, mainly incendiary bombs.

The Battle of Berlin was a failure for the Royal Air Force as it was not the knockout blow that Air Chief Marshal Harris had predicted and during the battle, the RAF lost 1,047 bombers, with a further 1,682 damaged, and well over 7,000 aircrew, culminating in the raid on Nuremberg on 30 March 1944, when 94 bombers were shot down and 71 damaged, out of 795 aircraft. There were many other raids on Berlin by the RAF and the USAAF Eighth Air Force in the strategic bombing campaign of 1940–1945 and this is reflected in the RAF battle honour, which is for bombardment of Berlin, by aircraft of Bomber Command 1940–1945.

The royal dockyards at HMNB Devonport were the main targets in order to facilitate Nazi German domination during the Battle of the Atlantic. Despite this, civilian casualties were very high and the dockyards continued in operation. The first bombs fell on the city on Saturday 6 July 1940 at Swilly, killing 3 people. In early 1941, five raids reduced much of the city to rubble. The last attack came on 30 April 1944. During the 59 bombing attacks, 1,172 civilians were killed and 4,448 injured. On the evening of 22 April 1941 during an attack on the central area, the communal air-raid shelter at Portland Square took a direct hit, which killed 70 people. A total of 3,754 houses were destroyed with a further 18,398 seriously damaged.;We have lost the air battle of Plymouth!\n\nThe Plymouth Blitz was a series of bombing raids carried out by the Nazi German Luftwaffe on the English city of Plymouth.

On May 31 1945, units of the Fifth Air Force consisting of 117 B-24 heavy bombers were sent to conduct the largest air raid ever on Taiwan. The bombing began at around ten o'clock in the morning and lasted until one o'clock in the afternoon, during which the attack was non-stop. The Allies dropped approximately 3,800 bombs on military units and governmental facilities in Taipei.

EVTDESC6001;We have won the Attack on Sydney Harbour!\n\nIn late May and early June 1942, submarines belonging to the Imperial Japanese Navy made a series of attacks on the cities of Sydney and Newcastle in Australia. On the night of 31 May - 1 June, three Ko-hyoteki class midget submarines entered Sydney Harbour and attempted to sink Allied warships. After being detected and attacked, the crews of two of the midget submarines scuttled their boats and committed suicide. The third submarine attempted to torpedo the heavy cruiser USS Chicago, but instead sank the converted ferry HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21 sailors. Immediately following the raid, the five Japanese fleet submarines that carried the midget submarines to Australia embarked on a campaign to disrupt merchant shipping in eastern Australian waters. Over the next month, the submarines attacked at least seven merchant vessels, sinking three ships and killing 50 sailors. During this period, two of the submarines bombarded the ports of Sydney and Newcastle.;We have won the Attack on Sydney Harbour!\n\nIn late May and early June 1942, submarines belonging to the Imperial Japanese Navy made a series of attacks on the cities of Sydney and Newcastle in Australia.

EVTDESC6070;We have won the Raid on Makin Island!\n\nThe Makin Island Raid took place from August 17, 1942 to August 18, 1942 and was an attack by the United States Marine Corps on the Japanese military. Although the Marine Raiders succeeded in annihilating the Japanese garrison on the island, the raid failed to meet its other material objectives. No Japanese prisoners were taken, and no meaningful intelligence was collected. Also, no significant Japanese forces were diverted from the Solomon Islands area. In fact, because the raid highlighted the vulnerabilities to their garrisons in the Gilbert Islands, the Japanese strengthened their fortifications and defensive preparations on the islands in the central Pacific, which may have caused heavier losses for U.S. forces during the battles of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns. However, the raid did succeed in its objectives of boosting morale and testing Raider tactics.;We have won the Raid on Makin Island!\n\nThe Makin Island Raid took place from August 17, 1942 to August 18, 1942 and was an attack by the United States Marine Corps on the Japanese military.

EVTDESC6111;We have lost the naval battle of Empress Augusta Bay!\n\nThe Battle of Empress Augusta Bay on 1–2 November 1943 was a naval battle fought near the island of Bougainville. The naval battle was a result of Allied landings on nearby Bougainville in the first action in the Bougainville campaign and may also be seen as part of the Solomon and New Guinea campaigns. The battle was significant as part of a broader Allied strategy aimed at isolating and surrounding the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The intention was to establish a beachhead on Bougainville, within which an airfield would be built. On 1 November 1943 the US 3rd Marine Division landed at Cape Torokina in Empress Augusta Bay. The bay had been chosen because it was at the outer limit of Allied fighter plane range, and because the numerically superior Japanese 17th Army was concentrated at other, more strategic sites in the north and the south. A force of four light cruisers and eight destroyers backed the Marines.;We have lost the naval battle of Empress Augusta Bay!\n\nThe Battle of Empress Augusta Bay on 1–2 November 1943 was a naval battle fought near the island of Bougainville.

The Japanese troops on the island put up a more effective defence than the Americans had anticipated. With some difficulty, the Americans were able to push the Japanese commander Yamasaki's men into a pocket near the coast of the island. Yamasaki and his remaining troops launched a surprise counter attack, executing a Banzai charge that broke through the American front line. Japanese troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with shocked American rear-echelon troops until most of the Japanese were killed. This charge effectively ended the battle for the island.

This enabled German naval codes to be read at Bletchley Park, providing the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid U-boat concentrations. The British returned with some 228 German prisoners, 314 loyal Norwegian volunteers and a number of Quisling collaborators.;We have lost the naval battle of the Lofoten Islands!\n\nThe British Armed forces raided the Lofoten Islands in Norway on 4 March 1941. Approximately 1,000 men of No. 3 and No. 4 Commando, 52 Norwegians of Norwegian Independent Company 1 and demolition teams from the 55th Field Squadron Royal Engineers conducted the raid. The force made an unopposed landing and generally continued to meet no opposition. They achieved their objective of destroying fish oil factories and some 3,600 tonnes of oil and glycerine.

EVTDESC6168;We have lost the naval battle of the Seychelles!\n\nThe battle was fought between the British heavy cruiser HMS Cornwall and the German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin. The battle began when the Royal Navy sighted the Pinguin and challenged what they thought was a merchant freighter. Pinguin fired her main battery and at least one shell hit the Royal Navy warship, causing little damage but enough to force HMS Cornwall to seek repairs after the battle. The British responded and after receiving several hits at and below the water line, Pinguin began to sink and her crew abandoned their ship. Aboard the Pinguin were merchant sailors that had been taken captive by the Germans from over thirty different allied vessels. The Pinguin was just as much a prison as she was a warship. Only twenty-two of the 222 prisoners aboard the Pinguin survived. About 332 Germans were killed, sixty of who were rescued and later imprisoned. Only one British sailor was killed in the engagement. A total of 533 men lost their lives that day.;We have lost the naval battle of the Seychelles!\n\nThe battle was fought between the British heavy cruiser HMS Cornwall and the German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin.

No Japanese prisoners were taken, and no meaningful intelligence was collected. Also, no significant Japanese forces were diverted from the Solomon Islands area. In fact, because the raid highlighted the vulnerabilities to their garrisons in the Gilbert Islands, the Japanese strengthened their fortifications and defensive preparations on the islands in the central Pacific, which may have caused heavier losses for U.S. forces during the battles of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns.

The fight for the control of the strategically important island of Malta pitted the air forces and navies of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany against the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. From Malta, British air and sea forces could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to the Axis forces in North Africa. Malta was one of the most intensively bombed areas during the war. The German Luftwaffe and the Italian Regia Aeronautica flew a total of 3,000 bombing raids over a period of two years.
