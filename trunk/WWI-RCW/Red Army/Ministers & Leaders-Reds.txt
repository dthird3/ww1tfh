The Red Army
The fighting force of the Bolsheviks was the Red Army, in full the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army, or Рабоче-Крестьянская Красная Армия, if you speak Russian.

The Red Army was created on January 28, 1918 (January 15, 1918 old style). In 1946, the Red Army became the Soviet Army.

Leon Trotsky
	

Leon Trotsky

People's Commissar of War (Bolshevik Government)
from March 26, 1918 until January 17, 1925.

    Before Trotsky became War Minister, the position of the People's Commissar of War and Navy was occupied by a committee of three. Krylenko, Dybenko and Ovseyenko were the three members of that committee from 1917 until 1918.

    When Trotsky became War Minister in March 1918, Krylenko became Commissar of Justice, Dybenko got fired, and Ovseyenko became commander of the troops in Southern Russia.

    Nikolay Nikolayevich Dukhonin

    Dukhonin was not a Red but somehow it makes sense to list him here because he was in charge of the Russian forces when the Bolsheviks came to power.

    Dukhonin had been Kerensky's chief-of-staff. Kerensky made him commander-in-chief when he, Kerensky, had to flee because the Bolsheviks shut down his government.

    On November 20, 1917 (November 7, 1917 old style) the Bolsheviks ordered Dukhonin to open peace negotiations with the Central Powers of World War I. Dukhonin refused and got sacked.
