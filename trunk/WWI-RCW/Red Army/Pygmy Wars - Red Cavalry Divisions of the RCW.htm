  Soviet Cavalry

The following material is all taken from the Encyclopedia of the Russian
Civil War and Intervention in the USSR but via the RRKA site
<http://www.rkka.ru/handbook/kd.htm>, where it is already in text form.

I auto-transliterated it into the Latin alphabet for the names,
search-and-replaced the most common phrases, and then tidied up a bit of
the text from the original to make sense of the histories. I wouldn't
say it was translated, as such.

There may be quite a few errors: this is intended as a quick reference
only. Look up the original if you want to be certain. Corrections are
welcome!

The first part lists all the divisions, giving the various alternative
names they went by. The second part then gives some details of their
commanders and histories.
