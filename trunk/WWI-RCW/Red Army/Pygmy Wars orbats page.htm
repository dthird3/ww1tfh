
  Orders of Battle

 
All orders of battle merely give a snapshot of the army at one point in
time: and the Russian Civil War even more so than most wars. What lists
we have tend to be associated with a reorganisation, so are much better
evidence for the months following than for the months preceding them.

The orbats I  have chosen are largely those where there are numbers
attached, which allows gamers to gauge some idea of the relative balance
of infantry : cavalry : MGs : guns.

NB: different armies counted differently. The Whites tended to count
just riflemen as "bayonets" and just line cavalry as "sabres", not
including any supporting troops like machine-gunners. The Reds tended to
count everyone in a rifle unit as a "bayonet". The Reds also tended to
have more non-combatants in a front-line unit than their opponents. It
is therefore inappropriate to just compare the bald figures directly.

The AFSR was divided into some major groupings. Here are those
front-line portions to the east (that is excluding the Ukraine, where
the Volunteer Army portion was) at the time of the rejig in Autumn 1919.
The AFSR was pretty much at its peak at this time:

Forces at the Battle of Orel, October 1919 <orelwhites.html>
   
During1920 the AFSR became the "Russian Army" under the leadership of
Baron Wrangel. There were a great many rearrangements, both big and
small, and units in the orders of battle might have no equipment or be
made up more or less entirely of POWs. Orbats for this period must
therefore be used with great caution, as they were out of date even as
they were being made.

This is the White Russian units operating on the Estonian border up to
May 1919.

their offensive can be found in the maps section <../maps/maps.html>.)

By late 1919 the Whites in this area were called the North-Western Army,
and under the command of General Iudenich. Although not actually doing
much fighting, their reluctant Estonian allies propped up the southern
wing. This is the list of units pretty much at the peak of the second
drive on Petrograd.

    Anti-Bolshevik forces in Siberia

The short-lived KOMUCH was never a great power but its campaigning in
co-ordination with the Czech Legion was the first serious threat to
Soviet power. Information about the People's Army is hard to find, hated
as it was by adherents of the extremist elements that came to dominate
the early writing up of the war, both Red and White.

The Urals Host was formally part of the main White forces in Siberia,
but operationally it kept separate. The Ataman commanded non-Cossack
forces and parts of other Hosts, and various orders of battle deal with
those in different ways. The Urals Host appears to have had both
territorial and numerical naming systems, which makes tracing units
difficult:

Urals Separate Army April-September 1919 <urals1919.html>

Urals Separate Army July 1919 <urals1919v2.html>

The Orenburg Host is very difficult to keep track of. Ataman Dutov
commanded large numbers of non-Cossack forces, but at the same time many
Orenburg Cossack regiments were dispersed to other commands. These
orders of battle do not list all the Orenburg units, just those in the
main Orenburg theatre.

A bit of a resource for tracking down Soviet Cavalry divisions:
especially useful for when they changed names.

An orbat for those elements of the Soviet Southern Front at the crucial
turning point of Denikin's drive on Moscow. Known as the Battle of Orel
or, in Soviet literature, as the Orel-Kromy Operation:
