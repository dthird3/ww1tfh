  Useful Terms


One problem with studying this period is the difficulty in understanding
terms. Especially if they have changed meaning somewhat over time.

The definitions are only intended to apply for the period 1917-1923.

  
AFSR : Armed Forces of South Russia – the covering name for the forces
commanded by General Denikin and then Baron Wrangel from January 1919
until May 1920. It included the Volunteer Army and the various Cossack
Host armies. It became the Russian Army.

Antanta : the transliterated version of the Russian for the Entente.

Bandit : 1) a bandit.
2) in Bolshevik terminology, any person opposing Soviet power by force,
especially those not belonging to the main White or Nationalist
factions. Also termed gangster.

Bashlyk : a large hood for bad weather, often coloured when worn by
Cossacks or Mountaineers.

Beshmet : shirt worn under a cherkeska by the the Caucasian mountaineers
and some Cossacks.

Beskozirka : a cap like a furazhka, but with no visor ("peakless" in
American terminology). Associated with students, sailors and the
coloured regiments.

Black : the colour associated with Anarchism. Anarchists are often
called "Blacks".

Black Hundreds : groups of ultra-reactionary Monarchists, usually
violently anti-Semitic.

Budenovka : another term for shlem.

Burka : large fur cape, associated with the Cossacks and Natives of the
Caucasus mountains.

Cadet : 1) a young man at officer training school.
2) a supporter of the Constitutional Democrat party.
3) a counter-revolutionary (the Constitutional Democrats being numerous
in the White armies).

ChEKa : the Soviet internal security force which combined military-,
security- and political- police functions. The initials come from the
"Extra-Ordinary Commission" portion of the full title: the All Russia
Extra-Ordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage.

Cherkeska : the traditional outer garment of the Caucasian tribesmen,
worn by Kuban and Terek Cossacks.

ChON : élite Communist military units (from the Russian initials of
Chasti Osobogo Naznacheniya, or Special Purpose Units).

Cockade : the badge on the front of a military hat, generally very
prominent in White armies.

Coloured, colourful : term applying to the Volunteer Army units that
wore uniform items of a colourful nature, mostly meaning the Kornilov,
Alekseev, Markov and Drozdovski, but also sometimes the Samursky and HQ
units.

Combined orComposite : the usual translations of svodni?. This term was
often used by White armies to describe units which were formed around
the core of a previous much larger unit, usually from the former
Imperial Army: thus, the "Composite Regiment of the 19th Infantry
Division" was a regiment formed around men who had formerly served in
the 19th ID.

Commissar : a politically reliable man placed inside a Red Army military
unit to further the revolution. Their functions were concerned with
propaganda and organising political activity and not military at this time.

Communist : Bolshevik.

Cossack : in Tsarist Russia a hereditary legal status, with rights and
responsibilities tied to service in Cossack units. After the revolution
the Ukrainians started to use it as a term for free soldier (its
original meaning) and this carried over to other armies, including the
Red Army. Not all later "Cossack" units were therefore formed of
Cossacks in the pre-1917 sense.

Czapka : the Polish for cap, of any variety (but see Rogatywka).

Directory : 1) when used of a Ukrainian government, another word for the
UNR.
2) when used in Siberia, the Ufa Directory.

Division : 1) the smallest unit in an army which mixes arms. Thus very
small units might be called "divisions" during the Pygmy Wars as there
was no other word to describe units which combined infantry / cavalry /
artillery.
2) a very common mistranslation of divizion (see below)
3) a misunderstanding of the name of a unit that is actually a much
smaller composite unit formed around a cadre from a previous Imperial
division.

Divizion : a Russian term for a unit between company and regiment size.
For artillery and armour the word "battalion" is appropriate, but
English does not have a standard translation for cavalry:
"demi-regiment" is one option. Note: it is often translated as
"division", which is quite inappropriate.

Entente : the alliance that included France, Britain and Russia at the
start of WWI was the Entente Cordiale. This came to be the termed used
by Russians where "Allies" is more commonly used in English. It became
Soviet dogma that all anti-Soviet forces were acting in collusion with
the Entente at all times. Thus the 1920 Polish war was sometimes
referred to as the "Third Entente Campaign".

Esau : Captain in the Cossack system of ranks.

Forces Group : an ad hoc collection of units for a particular task
placed under the leadership of one man.

Front : in the Red Army what is usually know as an Corps. Thus several
Fronts might be at a front.

Furazhka : the standard Russian service cap.

Galicia : the eastern portion of the Ukraine that had been Austrian in 1914.

Gangster : in Bolshevik terminology, any person opposing Soviet power by
force, especially those not belonging to the main White or Nationalist

Russian blouse, with or without a couple of pockets on the breast and
with no fold-down on the collar.

Horse : a term often used for units which mixed cavalry with infantry,
but sometimes just an alternative for cavalry.

Host : the usual translation of Voisko, applying to both the Cossack
states and their armies.

IRA : Imperial Russian Army.

International : 1) a term for a person from outside the borders of the
Russian Empire serving in the Red Army. There were quite a few units of
"Internationals", especially early in the Civil War.
               2) the international Communist organisation founded in
March 1919, also known as the Comintern (for Communitst International)
or the Third International, dedicated to world-wide Marxist revolution.

Interventionist : the standard Soviet term for the forces from
non-Russian powers which intervened in the Russian Civil War. Includes
both the Entente and Central Powers (Germany, Austro-Hungary and Turkey).

Kadet : see Cadet (2) and (3).

Kaftan : a coat, but often used for cherkeska.

Kittel : an officer's tunic.

Constituent Assembly: a Socialist but anti-Bolshevik government based in

(along with the term gaubitsa).

from Russia, whether Socialist or not.

NDA : the Russian Peoples' Volunteer Army, which formed in Poland in
late 1920, under the control of Boris Savinkov.

using the Russian letters): i.e. a “commissar”.
