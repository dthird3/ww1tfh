  Tables of Organisation

 
Since I like to game with historical formations and I couldn't find any
source that matched the theoretical TOEs with the actual numbers seen in
practice, I wrote my own.

I welcome any corrections.
 

The first version was really intended for use with the Principles of War
rule set, but since I have indicated the unit strengths by numbers of
bayonets/sabres it is pretty universal.

The second version is specifically for Red Actions! since it assumes
that players are using bases as the standard measure of strength and
forming company-sized units (often titled battalions, however).
Generally I have worked on the basis that a base represents 30-40 rifles
or sabres, 4 MGs or 2 guns.)

smaller actual units merged.
   


      Coverage

The tables are for mid-1919 through 1920 only. Prior to that units
tended to be assembled with whatever was at hand rather than in any sort
of recognised structure, and old Imperial practice is a reasonable guide.

The ranks shown are indicative only, since the Red ranks do not
translate very well into English and the Whites often used men with
different ranks for the same level of command, having a surplus of officers.

The theoretical structures are shown but only for the purposes of
knowing possible maximums, it is the "actual" values which are more
important. Likewise technical support units listed on paper were often
completely absent in practice.
 


      Strengths shown

The Red units are mostly based on typical strengths at Orel/Kromy and at
the battle of Warsaw. Poles on the battle of Warsaw. AFSR units are more
speculative, since they varied so wildly according to the fortunes of
the army. The number of men indicated for units, while based on an
observation of real strengths, are nevertheless given solely as
indicative averages and units might vary above or below the ranges shown
by quite a lot (depending how the campaign was going). The requirement
for sensible unit sizes on the table means that sometimes in order to
"normalise" the size of units, I have merged two or more small units
(especially cavalry) when allocating "actual" rather than theoretical
strengths.

It should be noted that the Reds counted differently from the Poles and
AFSR, so mere comparison of strengths found in much literature can be
misleading. Pilsudski discusses this a bit in his book Year 1920, and
Tom Hillman explains it further in some old posts on the Yahoo Russian
Civil War group. Basically the Whites tended to count only actual
bayonets or sabres, while the Reds used the number of men in the unit.
Often the supposed numerical superiority of the Soviet forces is largely
removed when one actually looks a bit deeper at the figures.

Corps or Army level assets are generally not included, unless allotted
on a semi-permanent basis. Therefore there are no tanks, trains, boats,
balloons etc, which were scarce and usually only allocated for battles
around strong defensive positions (e.g. Tsaritsyn, Radzymin and
Perekop). Artillery provisions are lighter than recorded strengths to
take account of the difficulties of repair and transport which often led
to guns being unavailable for combat. If a set-piece battle is intended
then artillery strengths can be increased (and army-level heavy guns
added as well in many cases).

It can be assumed that all artillery units had a couple of integral
machine-guns per battery, mounted as tachankas for the horse artillery.
For all but the smallest scale games, I would normally expect this to be
included in the general factors for the guns – adding slightly to the
close range shooting factors and increasing the melee levels (especially
against flank attacks).
  


    Notes on specific armies


      Red Rifle Divisions

These varied enormously in size, but ones in the front line in important
sectors were less variable. When strengths fell they sometimes pared
down to two brigades, which tends to average out battalion size a bit. 

The two actual battalions fielded per regiment is to represent it having
about six companies (of 50 bayonets each). This may be represented by
two “battalions” of 4 to 6 bases, but may equally be represented by
three “battalions” of 3 to 4 bases. The men were moved around inside a
division to even out numbers, so units will tend to be equal sized.

The Reds raised whole brigades at a time, and preferred to withdraw them
in their entirety to refit or absorb reinforcements. Therefore normally
the type of all units in a normal rifle brigade was be the same, though
different brigades in the same division might differ slightly in
experience or origin.

An exception to this were the not uncommon brigades raised in an
emergency, which might include regiments (but not smaller units) hastily
thrown together, although it would be rare for good quality units to be
mixed with poor quality. Therefore one might see brigaded together
regiments of sailors, kursanty (Red students), “Internationalists”
and/or dedicated communist factory workers or another with pressed
Cossacks, rounded up deserters and units crossed over from the enemy
(i.e. all conscripts).  Such brigades would normally be short on
artillery and technical support and might be independent of any
divisional structure.

The cavalry of rifle regiments was most often of poor quality. It was
mainly for scouting and supplying messengers, not charging.

The artillery lacked trained commanders and often had faulty ammunition,
which decreased its effectiveness considerably.

The elite divisions, such as the Latvians, tended to be larger and
better equipped. They might have the full complement of 3 brigades, each
of 9 battalions, with MG company, and increased support units to match.
Even then battalions might not have three companies each.

“Commissars” (technically member of the RevCom – revolutionary
committee) were ordered during this period to keep their noses out of
purely military matters, though they were to keep a close eye on
unreliable former Tsarist officers. Depending on the commissar in
question, he might or might not obey the order.
  


      Red Cavalry Divisions

There is no integral infantry in a Red cavalry unit, and foot and
mounted rarely worked together – the Konnarmiya had several infantry
divisions with it, but these were almost completely ignored by Budënniy
(instead they performed garrison and rear area security missions and
they were very ordinary as infantry). Tachankas and reasonably plentiful
horse artillery supplied the required fire-power. Although it is often
cited that the Konnarmiya had lots of technical support, these either
could not keep up or are largely imaginary (especially the air support)
so the most that might be expected is an occasional armoured car.

Independent cavalry brigades were not uncommon in the Red Army. They
were frequently Cossack or other minority groups such as Bashkirs or Tatars.

Again, units will tend to be of equal skill level and size within
brigades, but brigades in a division might vary in quality.

Red cavalry divisions were proper cavalry, quite prepared to charge
mounted, but were equally happy to use firepower to achieve an
objective, and often dismounted en masse. Lancers were rare, but more
common towards the end.
 


      ASFR Infantry Divisions

The central drive for uniformity was not as strong in the AFSR, and men
and captured equipment were not transferred between units so much,
leading to greater variety in strengths and organisation. The older
units of the VA were particularly prone to going their own way. Note:
when the Whites counted “bayonets” or “sabres” they usually meant
exactly that, meaning even machine-gunners were not counted, which tends
to make their numbers look much smaller than they actually were.

Regiments often had an old officer core which stuck together in the
first battalion, but they also frequently added new recruits wholesale
as new battalions or companies to existing units, so regiments might
have battalions of very different types and quality. However, each
regiment in the division would tend to have the same sort of mixture of
troop types, whatever that might be. Normally the regiments had three
battalions, but in order to represent extra-large first battalions four
wargames units might be fielded. Alternatively, the extra unit might
represent the “officer” companies of the older regiments, in which case
it would be smaller than a normal battalion (although still large for a
company). Four battalions was also the old Imperial practice, so perhaps
some retained it into the RCW.

Sometimes a brigade had a fourth regiment, which was the depot or
reserve regiment. This was normally smaller (often just a battalion) and
of lower quality.

The regimental cavalry was true cavalry. The armoured cars were
technically attached, rather than permanent.

The elite “coloured” units tended to form the spearhead of any attack by
the Volunteer Army. They varied tremendously in size over time, but when
they were at their peak they included their greatest number of new
recruits and the quality dropped considerably, especially in the 3rd and
4th battalions. At their largest (i.e. Orel) the battalions were large
enough to justify splitting into a couple of units for the table (the
theoretical number of companies was four). At all times these units were
the most heavily endowed with support in terms of heavy artillery,
armoured trains, planes etc.

The AFSR tended to have complete dominance of the air, but planes
generally only attacked massed targets and the rear areas.
 


      ASFR Cavalry Divisions

Part of the success of the White armies in south Russia, and
particularly the VA, is that it operated much more in conjunction with
its infantry. A weakness was that horses were often in short supply, so
the attached infantry might actually represent cavalry without horses
(they could well be the third brigade).

A division is either Cossack or Regular, not mixed, even though many of
the troopers forming the regular cavalry were, in fact, Cossacks.
Recruits into the cavalry tended to be trained horsemen, so there is no
equivalent of the conscript battalions found in the infantry. Most units
of cavalry were half lance armed except the Kuban and Terek Cossacks,
who did not use them. Men were much more reluctant than the Reds to
dismount or use mounted firepower (and anyway they more often had decent
infantry to call on).

Although very old-fashioned in many respects, the White cavalry were not
stupid and realised the value of tachankas to a mounted force, even if
they did not use as many as the Reds. They also knew the value of
armoured cars and trains, but these tended to hinder their ability to
move fast and freely so they were not normally attached to cavalry
divisions.
 


      Cossack Divisions

Cossack divisions use normal AFSR structures but with a tendency to be
much smaller and frequently lacking parts of the structure. Mixed units
of half infantry and half cavalry were quite common, especially in the
Don Host.

Don units, and to a lesser extent Kuban ones, had some supporting arms
like planes, armoured trains and armoured cars, though not to as great
an extent as the AFSR. The Terek and Mountaineer units tended to be very
small and contain much more cavalry and little supporting arms.

On the whole the Cossack and regular AFSR units fought separately,
though sometimes a brigade or division of one sort might be attached to
the other for a while.
 


      White armies in Siberia and the North-west

Siberian armies used old Imperial organisations. According to Valery
Klaving:

By order of Admiral Kolchak, dated 3 January 1919, the new Russian army
was to have the structure and composition of the old Russian army under
Nicholas II. That is the structure was based on a company (150 bayonets
each), battalions (of 4 companies), regiments (4,100 bayonets, in 4
battalions or 16 companies), divisions (16,500 bayonets in 4 regiments)
and corps (37,000 of two divisions each).

It was unlikely that official strengths were kept at the front line, but
it provides a base.

Though there was a some good cavalry the infantry tended to be far more
uneven. There were fewer officer units and veterans and lots more
conscripts (many extremely unreliable). Artillery and other technical
support was less plentiful. Again the Cossacks tended to fight separately.

Yudenich’s army was supplied with good technical support, but lacked
large cavalry formations. The infantry was mediocre and lacked the big
elite units found in the south and, to a lesser extent, east. In any
case, his army is small enoughand altered size so wildly that actual
units would normally be better than using formal TOEs.
 


      Polish Infantry Divisions

The size of Polish units varied very considerably and the average size
is not terribly useful, especially since the amount of support weapons
varied just as wildly but quite independently of the number of bayonets.
Therefore the base units might be the three companies of each battalion,
or the whole battalion might only number a couple of hundred men. The MG
support might or might not match.

The army absorbed an enormous number of new recruits just before (and
during) the 1920 campaign against the Soviets. The higher numbered
battalions might therefore be almost untrained, even in very old
regiments, although Pilsudski’s favoured Legion units would have had the
best recruits and suffered the least in this regard.

An infantry division seems to have been supplied with anything from a
small squadron to a whole regiment of divisional cavalry, apparently at
random. The cavalry units in the infantry tended to be the lower quality
ones, though mostly still “real” cavalry.

Poles had air superiority. They particularly liked attacking the supply
system, Bolshevik cavalry on the march and trains.
 


      Polish Cavalry Divisions

The highest proper formation of the Polish cavalry was the brigade.
Sometimes two (rarely three) were grouped into divisions, but this was
really still a grouping of brigades – there were no divisional assets.
The Polish cavalry brigades not only had no integral infantry, they
virtually always operated independently.

As with the Polish  infantry, average sizes can be misleading. Regiments
were frequently reduced to tiny sizes during a campaign, but because
they recruited separately it was not unusual for one to have less than
200 sabres but be fighting alongside one, from the same brigade, with
400 effectives.

The fifth squadron of a regiment was a “technical” squadron, which was
meant to supply scouts, messengers, communications, engineering
assistance etc. In practice the fast moving campaigns and shortage of
manpower meant they usually fought alongside the other squadrons.

The Poles were very fond of tachankas and sometimes had extraordinary
numbers of them.
 


      Estonian and Latvian Divisions

The dispersed nature of the fighting meant that the divisions were
really just groupings of regiments, so artillery and cavalry would
normally be permanently attached to a regiment. The structure was very
flexible – companies were often chopped and changed temporarily across
to other regiments in a division to strengthen a particular point, and
regiments moved to reinforce other divisions.

Companies might vary quite a bit in size but the bulk of a regiment
would normally be of the same basic type. The exceptions would be for
new recruits forming a fourth company or, rarely, a fourth battalion.
For game purposes small companies might need to be merged.

Estonian regiments might also be strengthened by the addition of either
an elite company or battalion from the armoured train division, either
with or without their trains. An armoured car or two might also work
with a division.

Nationalist cavalry was generally neither numerous nor very good,
although the Estonians formed a couple of separate regiments.  Its main
roles were to scout and provide messengers and orderlies and to get into
the enemy’s rear. They should probably be considered mounted infantry,
able only to charge with sabres against enemy already retiring or
baggage elements.

The scouts were divided into foot scout and horse scout companies. There
were often quite a few of them and the foot scouts, in particular,
frequently acted as another (small) infantry company.

The HMG ratio was fairly low but supplemented by LMGs (and the companies
also usually had a few).
 


      Freikorps Columns

The Freikorps structure was very loose, and it is hard to give any sort
of average. The basic unit structures followed the German ones for the
end of WWI, but shortages of manpower meant units were very short handed.

A typical battalion would normally have three companies (not often the
standard four) but sometimes only two, each not often more than 100 men,
and usually an MG company of up to 8 HMGs. A small mortar unit was a
common addition, although often just a couple of light mortars. There
were also several battalions of specialist MG “sharpshooters” with three
MG companies and perhaps an infantry company or two in support.

The Freikorps tended to fight in independent columns, based around a
“regiment” of two or three such infantry battalions, one or which might
be a MG sharpshooter battalion. The column would most often have a small
squadron of cavalry (rarely more) and several batteries (often including
howitzers). It might also include an engineer company, bicycle platoon
or an armoured car. Flame-throwers, infantry support guns and armoured
trains existed, but were not so common. Aerial support was normal,
though generally limited to spotting and dropping messages.

The Freikorps had a much higher proportion of HMGs, LMGs, cavalry and
artillery than their nationalist opponents. Thus, although they were
heavily outnumbered in the infantry, approximately equal numbers of
support weapons were fielded. They were very well equipped with radios,
telephones, field glasses etc.

Freikorps cavalry does not seem to have charged mounted during the
period, but I cannot firmly state that they would never have done it.
They were lance armed, it seems.
