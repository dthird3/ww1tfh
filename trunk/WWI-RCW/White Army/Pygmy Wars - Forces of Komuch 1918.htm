  Komuch 

 
Taken from List of military units, agencies and institutions of the
People's Army by A. A. Karevski in White Guard Almanac #3 (Posev, Moscow
1999/2000) except the Kazan numbers, which are from Kappel' and the
Kappelevtsy (Posev, Moscow, 2003).

This is the Peoples' Army of the Members of the Constituent Assembly
(Komuch) pretty much at its maximum territorial extent, just as the Red
Army started to get its act together. Volkov gives the strength of the
Peoples' Army at 15,000 bayonets and sabres by the start of August.

Also listed are those Orenburg District Forces designated as part of
this army (there were separate Host units as well). But not listed are
the Czech forces which supplied much of the strike force at this time.

Clearly this order of battle is an idealised arrangement: in practice
each division dispatched parts of its forces to the fronts as they
could. These assorted detachments were formed into various ad hoc
brigades and groups, mixed in with Czechs, partisans and volunteer units.

I have left out all inspectorate positions and most non-fighting units
(medical, sanitation, supply etc).
