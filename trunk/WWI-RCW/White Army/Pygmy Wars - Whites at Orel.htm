  AFSR at Orel

10 - 27 October 1919


The primary source of the units involved in the Orel-Kromy Operation is
Seargent Magazine #5, which was available for a while on the web.

To that I have added sub-units and numbers taken from Volkov's
Encyclopedia of the Civil War: the White Units dating from 18 October
1919 (5 October "old style"). More than ever these present just a "snap
shot" at a particular time, as units were being formed and destroyed at
a bewildering rate.

The units listed are part of the Volunteer Army under Lieutenant-General
Mai-Maevskiy.
 


    I Army Corps

Commander – Lieutenant-General Kutepov
Chief of Staff – Major-General Dostavalov


      1st Infantry Division

Chief of Staff – Colonel Bittenbinder

Black Sea Cavalry Regiment – Colonel Glavche

Attached from the 9th Infantry Division

1st General Alekseev Partisan Infantry Regiment – Colonel Prince Gagarin
– approx 1,000 bayonets
2nd General Alekseev Partisan Infantry Regiment (recently formed)


There were mounted components in the Kornilov Regiments unrecorded by
Volkov, around 200 sabres each. The Black Sea Cavalry Regiment acted as
separate squadrons, supporting the Markov Brigade, at this time.

The strength of this division declined rapidly during the fighting
around Orel and Kromy. The strengths above are quite a lot lower than
the peak numbers of the start of the battle –the Kornilov Brigade had
started with over 6,000 bayonets.

This division was within weeks split into the Kornilov and Markov
Divisions (the artillery being split between them).


      3rd Infantry Division

Commander– Major-General Vitkovskiy
Chief of Staff – Colonel Bredov

1st Brigade

Brigade Commander – Major-General Kel'ner

1st General Drozdovsky Officer Rifle Regiment – Colonel Rummel – 1,352
bayones, 45 MGs
2nd General Drozdovsky Officer Rifle Regiment – Colonel Turkul – 1,309
bayonets, 55 MGs

3rd General Drozdovsky Officer Rifle Regiment (forming) – Colonel Dron –
1,130 bayonets, 12 MGs
83rd Samursky Infantry Regiment – Colonel Zvyagin – 1,304 bayonets, 26 MGs

Divisional Assets

Reserve Battalion of the 3rd Division – Colonel Yen'kov – 850 bayonets,
4 MGs
Composite Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Brigade – 861 sabres, 10 MGs
3rd General Drozdovsky Engineer Company – Colonel Borodin – 228 men

The infantry units likely had cavalry components unrecorded by Volkov
(or there were dispersed squadrons of a cavalry unit operating with the
infantry regiments). As with the 1st Division, unit strengths fell
rapidly during the battle.

Soon afterwards this became the Drozdovskiy Division,with the Samurskiy
going to the Alekseev Division..


      9th Infantry Division

Attached to the 1st Division

General Alekseev Partisan Infantry Regiment – Colonel Prince Gagarin
2nd General Alekseev Partisan Infantry Regiment (recently formed)

Not at Orel-Kromy

Composite Rifle Regiment – Colonel Gravitskiy (in rear fighting Makhno)
13th Belozerskiy Infantry Regiment – Colonel Shteyfon (Forces of the
Kiev Area)
14th Olonetskiy Infantry Regiment – (Forces of the Kiev Area)

This division was only recently formed, out of 1st Division (Alekseevs)
and 3rd Division (Belozerskiy, Olonetskiy and Composite Rifle) expanded
largely from POWs. Only the Alekseevs were present at the battles for
Orel and Kromy, the others being further west or in the rear.

The Alekseev Regiments became the Alekseev Division soon afterwards, the
remainder carrying on until merged into the Drozdovsky Division in
January 1920.


      Corps Assets

3rd Separate Heavy Howitzer Divizion

Separate Heavy Tractor Gun Divizion

Commander – Colonel Sakhnovskiy

2nd Armored Train Divizion (attached to 1st Infantry Division)

Commander – Colonel Gromyko

"Officer" (light) – Colonel Lebedev
"General Kornilov" (light) – Captain Molchanov – (operating with
Alexeyev Regiment)
"Ivan Kalita" (heavy) – Colonel Zelenetsky

9th Armored Train Divizion (attached to 3rd Infantry Division)

"Drozdovets" (light) – Captain Ripke
"The Thunder of Victory" (light) – ?
"Soldier" (heavy) – Colonel Ziegler

2nd Tank Detachment

5 tanks

1st Armoured Car Divizion

Kornilov
Glorious
Kubanets
General Drozdovskiy
others under repair

1st Corps Engineer Company

256 men

The slower moving parts of the Corps played little or no part in the
battles. The tanks, in particular, were unable to keep pace with the
fast moving operations. It seems unlikely the heavy guns fared much better.

Also at the battle, but part of the 5th Cavalry Corps was:


    1st Cavalry Division

Commander– Major-General Chekotavskiy
Chief of Staff – Colonel Kreyter

1st Brigade

Brigade Commander – Colonel Barbovich

1st General Alekseev Officer Cavalry Regiment – Colonel Saburov – 196
sabres, 16 MGs
10th Ingermanlandskiy Hussar Regiment – Captain Tikhonravov – 270
bayonets, 240 sabres

2nd Brigade

Composite Regiment of the 9th Cavalry Division – Colonel Vygran – 622
bayonets, 230 sabres, 30 MGs
Composite Regiment of the 12th Cavalry Division – Colonel Psiol – 396
bayonets, 161 sabres

3rd Brigade

Brigade Commander – Major-General Alenich

Composite Hussar Regiment – Colonel Gaevskiy
Composite Lancer Regiment – Colonel Aprelev – 310 bayonets, 95 sabres, 6
MGs

3rd Horse-Artillery Divizion

Divizion Commander – Colonel Prince Avalov

1st General Drozdovsky Separate Mountain-Horse Battery – Captain Yermolov
Composite Battery of the Caucasian Separate Mountain-Horse Artillery
Divizion
7th Horse Mountain Battery (uncertain)

It appears that only the 1st Brigade was involved directly in the
fighting around Orel. The rest was further east.
