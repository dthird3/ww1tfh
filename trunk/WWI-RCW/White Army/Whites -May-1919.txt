Siberian Army - the numbers

The Siberian Army was formed on 26
May 1918 in Novonikolaevsk after the overthrow of the Bolshevik authority of
the Temporary Siberian Government using the base staff of the Western Siberia
Military District. On 13 June 1918, it
was the Western Siberia Independent Army and was renamed on 27 June 1918 to the
Siberian Army. The staff of the army
coordinated the activity of all White
Forces in Siberia and the Far East. At
the beginning of June, the Army totaled 4000 men. By 18 June, there were 6047 (4332 rifles,
1215 sabers, and 500 unarmed soldiers). At
the end of June, 7600 men, 19 cannons, and 30 machineguns. By the middle of July, there were 23,400
men. By 31 July, there were 6970
officers, 28,229 volunteers. By 8
August, there were more than 40,000 men (nearly 10,000 officers and the
remainder were volunteers). By 20
September, 1918, the Army had called up about 166,000 men and was already
larger than the Volunteer Army. The
combat composition of the Army on 1 September was 60,200 men (according to
other data, there were only 37,600 men, 70 cannons, and 184 machineguns), and
on 1 October, there were 10,700 officers, 59,900 men, and 113,900 unarmed
soldiers.



The Siberian Army was renamed to the Siberian Independent
Army by 24 December 1918. By the end of
April, 1919, the Siberian Independent Army had approximately 40,000 soldiers
(this is the combat component). By the
end of Spring 1919, the Army had liberated Okhansk, Osu, Sarapul, and
Izhevsk. By June, the Army had split
into Northern and Southern Groups, Composite Shock Siberian and 8th
Kamsk Army Corps', and the 1st Cavalry Division. In July 1919, the Army totaled 350,000 men
(56,600 rifles, 3900 sabers, 600 machineguns, 164 cannons, 4 armored trains,
and 9 airplanes).
