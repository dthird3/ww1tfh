cession_of_hatay_desc;After the Great War, Hatay (then known as Alexandretta) became part of the French Mandate of Syria. Alexandretta was confirmed as Syrian territory in the Treaty of Lausanne agreed upon by Atatürk in 1923, although it was granted a special autonomous status because of its large Turkish minority. However, following a series of border disputes, Atatürk obtained in 1937 an agreement with France recognizing Alexandretta as an independent state, called the Republic of Hatay. In 1938, Turkey crossed tens of thousands of Turks into Hatay, and the Turkish military forcibly expelled most of the other ethnicities. On 29 June 1939, following a referendum, Hatay was annexed to Turkey. France was accommodating to Turkish demands, its attention being focused on Germany.
