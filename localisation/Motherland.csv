The goal was to drive to the coast, then encircle and destroy the Allied armies in Belgium in the hopes that this would force the Allies to make peace so German forces could be concentrated in the east. Launched on the 16th of December 1944 the attack achieved almost total surprise, and poor weather prevented the Allies from making use of their vastly superior air forces. However, despite inital success, fierce resistance slowed until the Allies were able to counter-attack and improving weather allowed them to make full use of their air power. The failure of the attack left Germany without enough troops to defend their western borders and hastened the Allied advance into Germany.
