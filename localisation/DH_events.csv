DH_EVENT_2001536_DESC;Despite its old alliance with Britain started with the Treaty of Windsor in 1386 (the oldest alliance in the world, which is still in force), Portugal did not form a part of the system of alliances involved in World War I and thus initially kept its neutrality. However, tensions between Germany and Portugal arose due to German U-Boat warfare which sought to blockade the United Kingdom - at the time the most important market for Portuguese products. Clashes also occurred with German troops in the south of the Portuguese colony of Angola in 1914 and 1915 (see German campaign in Angola). Initially, both the Portuguese and the German Governments officially stuck to neutrality. Unofficially, there were many hostile engagements between the countries. Portugal wanted to comply with British requests and also protect its colonies in Africa, and ultimately tensions resulted in war between Portugal and Germany being declared.;Despite its old alliance with Britain started with the Treaty of Windsor in 1386 (the oldest alliance in the world, which is still in force), Portugal did not form a part of the system of alliances involved in World War I and thus initially kept its neutrality.

DH_EVENT_2001538_DESC;Brazil officially declared neutrality on August 4, 1914. Only one Brazilian ship, the Rio Branco, was sunk by a German submarine in the early years of the war on May 3, 1916, but this was in restricted waters, operating with the English and most of its crew were composed of Norwegians, so that despite the national upheaval that has motivated, could not be considered an illegal attack from the Germans. At the beginning of the war, although neutral, Brazil faced a complicated social and economic situation. Its economy was largely based on exports of agricultural products such as coffee, latex, and industrial manufacturing. As this was not essential (customs and rents, the main source of the government) decreased with the conflict. This was accentuated further with the German blockade, and then to ban the importation of coffee into England in 1917, now considering the cargo space on ships necessary for more vital goods, given the great losses caused by merchant ships sunk by the Germans. Relations between Brazil and the German Empire was shaken by the German decision to allow its submarines to sink any ship that entered the areas of blockage. On April 5, 1917, the steam Brazilian Paraná, one of the largest merchant navy ships in the world (4,466 tons), loaded with coffee, browsing in accordance with the demands made on neutral countries, was torpedoed by a German submarine miles of cable Barfleur in France, and three Brazilians were killed.

DH_EVENT_2002555_DESC;When Clemenceau became Prime Minister in 1917 victory seemed to be a long way off. There was little activity on the Front because it was believed that there should be limited attacks until the American support arrived. At this time, Italy was on the defensive, Russia had virtually stopped fighting and it was believed they would be making a separate peace with Germany. At home the government had to combat increasing resentment against the war, peace demonstrations, scarcity of resources and air raids (which were causing huge physical damage to Paris as well as damaging the morale of its citizens). It was a challenging situation for Clemenceau, because after years of criticizing other men during the war, he suddenly found himself in a position of supreme power. He did not have close links with any parliamentary leaders (especially after years of criticism) and so had to rely on himself and his friends. Clemenceau's ascension to power meant little to the men in the trenches at first. Slowly, however, as time passed, the confidence he inspired in a few began to grow throughout all the fighting men. They were encouraged by his many visits to the trenches. This confidence began to spread from the trenches to the home front and it was said 'We believed in Clemenceau rather in the way that our ancestors believed in Joan of Arc.' It was widely recognised that throughout the war he was never discouraged and he never stopped believing that France could achieve total victory. There were sceptics, however, that believed that Clemenceau, like other war time leaders, would have a short time in office.

On 16th August to preserve their neutrality the Ottoman Empire feigned a purchase of these ships, but in fact the German crew was kept ready for operations on board.\nThe First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill intended to violate the neutrality of the Ottomans and to sink the German ships in Ottoman waters, but the British government refused such an aggressive behavior. After the Ottoman Black Sea Fleet under the command of Souchon attacked Russian ports on 29th October, the British demanded from the Ottoman Empire to expel the German military mission and to intern the crew of Goeben and Breslau. The Ottoman government rejected this demand. Without consultation with his government, Churchill ordered the fleet to bombard the Dardanelles. The British government had no other choice but to declare war on the Ottoman Empire on 5th November, when the war was already unofficially ongoing for 5 days.;;;;;;;;;;x

Over the next two days, there have been numerous meetings between the Ottoman government and the 'Committee of Union and Progress' to discuss the next step.

DH_EVENT_2191580_DESC;The German military had already operated in the Ottoman Empire for decades. The first German military mission was active from 1882 to 1895 to reorganize the Ottoman army. After that a military attaché office was established, but its influence was much less than that of the mission. Only the disastrous defeat in the First Balkan War in 1913 motivated the Ottoman army to request again German help for reforming the army. After months of negotiations, the second German military mission arrived in Constantinople in December 1913 under the leadership of Otto Liman von Sanders. Actually it was scheduled that the military mission would withdraw in case of war. With signing of the secret treaty between the German and the Ottoman Empire on 2nd August 1914 it was agreed that the mission should stay in Constantinople. It was promised that the mission would get a vast influence on the conduct of war of the Ottoman army. Many German officers would hold leadership positions. Numerous officers, specialists and troops were deployed during the war. It is estimated that approximately 25,000 men were in use for the military mission. The Ottoman army was supplied with weapons and aircrafts. Since the sea was locked, material and human support could only be sent overland to the Ottoman Empire. Since the German Empire was at war with Serbia, the supply could only be sent through neutral Romania, but this was not enough. However in mid-September 1914 Romania refused the transit permit and so the Ottoman Empire was cut off from support from the German Empire.

The Soviets accepted a peace treaty and the formal agreement, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was ratified on 6 March.\nThe treaty, signed between Soviet Russia on the one side and the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Ottoman Empire on the other, marked Russia's final withdrawal from World War I. In all, the treaty took away territory that included a quarter of the Russian Empire's population, a quarter of its industry and nine-tenths of its coal mines.;;;;;;;;;;x

The Bolsheviks reacted quickly and launched a successful counterattack which led to the arrest of the revolters.

2001536_decision_desc;Despite its old alliance with Britain started with the Treaty of Windsor in 1386 (the oldest alliance in the world, which is still in force), Portugal did not form a part of the system of alliances involved in World War I and thus initially kept its neutrality. However, tensions between Germany and Portugal arose due to German U-Boat warfare which sought to blockade the United Kingdom - at the time the most important market for Portuguese products. Clashes also occurred with German troops in the south of the Portuguese colony of Angola in 1914 and 1915 (see German campaign in Angola). Initially, both the Portuguese and the German Governments officially stuck to neutrality. Unofficially, there were many hostile engagements between the countries.

2001538_decision_desc;Brazil officially declared neutrality on August 4, 1914.

At the beginning of the war, although neutral, Brazil faced a complicated social and economic situation. Its economy was largely based on exports of agricultural products such as coffee, latex, and industrial manufacturing. As this was not essential (customs and rents, the main source of the government) decreased with the conflict. This was accentuated further with the German blockade, and then to ban the importation of coffee into England in 1917, now considering the cargo space on ships necessary for more vital goods, given the great losses caused by merchant ships sunk by the Germans.

2002555_decision_desc;When Clemenceau became Prime Minister in 1917 victory seemed to be a long way off. There was little activity on the Front because it was believed that there should be limited attacks until the American support arrived. At this time, Italy was on the defensive, Russia had virtually stopped fighting and it was believed they would be making a separate peace with Germany. At home the government had to combat increasing resentment against the war, peace demonstrations, scarcity of resources and air raids (which were causing huge physical damage to Paris as well as damaging the morale of its citizens). It was a challenging situation for Clemenceau, because after years of criticizing other men during the war, he suddenly found himself in a position of supreme power. He did not have close links with any parliamentary leaders (especially after years of criticism) and so had to rely on himself and his friends. Clemenceau's ascension to power meant little to the men in the trenches at first. Slowly, however, as time passed, the confidence he inspired in a few began to grow throughout all the fighting men. They were encouraged by his many visits to the trenches. This confidence began to spread from the trenches to the home front and it was said 'We believed in Clemenceau rather in the way that our ancestors believed in Joan of Arc.' It was widely recognised that throughout the war he was never discouraged and he never stopped believing that France could achieve total victory. There were sceptics, however, that believed that Clemenceau, like other war time leaders, would have a short time in office.

The Soviets accepted a peace treaty and the formal agreement, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was ratified on 6 March.\nThe treaty, signed between Soviet Russia on the one side and the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Ottoman Empire on the other, marked Russia's final withdrawal from World War I. In all, the treaty took away territory that included a quarter of the Russian Empire's population, a quarter of its industry and nine-tenths of its coal mines.;;;;;;;;;;x

2191546_decision_desc;Born in Burg Belchau near Graudenz in the Province of Prussia, Falkenhayn became a career soldier. Between 1896 and 1903 he served in Qing China, and saw action during the Boxer Rebellion. Afterward, the Army posted him to Brunswick, Metz, and Magdeburg, with ever-increasing rank. In 1913, he became Prussian Minister of War, in which capacity he acted as one of the key players in the genesis of World War I when the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo took place. Like most German military, he did not then count on an overall war, but he very soon embraced the idea and belonged to those pushing Kaiser Wilhelm II to declare war. Falkenhayn succeeded Moltke as Chief of the General Staff of the German Army after the Battle of the Marne on 14 September 1914. Confronted with the failure of the Schlieffen Plan due to Moltke's interference, he attempted to outflank the British and French in the 'Race to the Sea', a series of engagements throughout northern France and Belgium in which each side tried to turn the others flank until they reached the coastline.
