
Quetzalcoatl: Konets for example
tillackt: maybe i need to look again
Quetzalcoatl: the idea is that Romania will only join as a punishment if the CP focus on the West
Quetzalcoatl: if the CP are attacking Russia Romania will stay out
Quetzalcoatl: besides it would be a Russian decision
Quetzalcoatl: that they can decide not to take if they feel threatened
tillackt: yeah, Romania is still very exposed to the CP.  If they join even with Germany focusing on France - AUH, BUL and OTTO are free to attack them
Quetzalcoatl: but Russian troops can poor into it
Quetzalcoatl: without fear of supply issues even
Quetzalcoatl: it's in a situation where the Entente still holds Salonica as well
Quetzalcoatl: the CP won't have that many guys to send
Quetzalcoatl: exept from the West
tillackt: humm, how many Russian troops can "pour" into Romania when Russia is struggleing to hold their shorter line without ROM?
Quetzalcoatl: are they struggling ?
Quetzalcoatl: in this game there was no attempt to push in Russia
Quetzalcoatl: and Russia had no trouble holding
Quetzalcoatl: I could see InMotion had at least 30 divisions lying around
Quetzalcoatl: doing nothing
Quetzalcoatl: he was blocked from attacking and no one wanted to attack him
tillackt: to cover the main line to ROM, Baltic coastal Defence and then cover the Caucasus as well as keep some reserves .... yes
tillackt: and then to upgrade the Army, Officers and tech
Quetzalcoatl: but Russia can simply not do it
Quetzalcoatl: if it feels like it can't bear the pressure
Quetzalcoatl: it's a decision
Quetzalcoatl: it's a decision in 1915 even
Quetzalcoatl: they have time to asses the situation before to make a decision
tillackt: yeah, I like the idea of trying ROM and regardless of our speculation we should tyr a few games and see how it works
tillackt: even a player dual screening ROM techs etc could be good just in case
Quetzalcoatl: if we give up on Japan
Quetzalcoatl: we will have a Russian coop
Quetzalcoatl: he can do that as well
Quetzalcoatl: on top of cooping
tillackt: yeah thats a fair idea
Quetzalcoatl: in general what we just need at the moment is a way to draw german troops from the West to the East
Quetzalcoatl: if Konets is the trigger city for a Romanian entry the Austrian will have to leave their defensive line, and once they do Russian can attack them, eventualy threaten them and force German movement
Quetzalcoatl: the problem this game was that Russia was unable to fight
Quetzalcoatl: even if they wanted to
Quetzalcoatl: there was simply no place to do so
tillackt: well that's what I though would happen if there was a risk that Russia could pull an "offensive" decision with bonuses that risks a Brusilov offensive style breakthrough
Quetzalcoatl: but those bonuses would have to be crazy to do anything
Quetzalcoatl: the fronts are lock tide
Quetzalcoatl: in Austria it's a city and rivers
Quetzalcoatl: with a 1 province plane corridor to push
Quetzalcoatl: and in Germany it's even worst
Quetzalcoatl: the amouts of buffs we would need to give to break that would be problematic
tillackt: yeah so we try your Romania plan a bit and just see how it works
Quetzalcoatl: from what I can see
Quetzalcoatl: Russia doesn't need better troops, it needs a better front
Quetzalcoatl: Romania can offer that
Quetzalcoatl: it should be threatening enough
Quetzalcoatl: of course a little russian buff would help as well
Quetzalcoatl: more officers or better research
tillackt: I'll see if I can spread out the Russian "leadership" cities a bit to also provide an incentive to attack russia or they just get more and more officers
tillackt: I just updated the Russian Guards Doctrines to current 1914 levels instead of 1900 level
tillackt: small I know but the Russian guards were good
Quetzalcoatl: that's helpful
Quetzalcoatl: it's something you can't afford to research anyway
tillackt: true
Quetzalcoatl: which probably mean this tech will stay the same for years
Quetzalcoatl: so it's actualy quite a buff
Quetzalcoatl: I would say
tillackt: actually I haven't looked but I wonder if the RUS MIL techs should be a little more up to date?  Russia always relied on a big MIL army
Quetzalcoatl: I don't realize how good or bad MIL are in the mod
tillackt: maybe just the Large Front Doctrine or something?
Quetzalcoatl: maybe give them the special doctrine that reduces stacking penalty by 5 ?
